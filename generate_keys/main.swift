            This tool uses the macOS Keychain to store a public/private key pair for signing app updates which
            will be distributed via Sparkle. This key will be associated with your user account.
            
            Note: You only need one signing key, no matter how many apps you embed Sparkle in.
            
            The keychain may ask permission for this tool to access an existing key, if one
            exists, or for permission to save the new key. You must allow access in order to
            successfully proceed.

            Additional Options:
            -p
                Looks up and just prints the existing public key stored in the Keychain.
            
            -s key-pair
                Stores the specified key-pair to your keychain instead of generating a new key.
                If you want to migrate keys from another machine, find \"\(PRIVATE_KEY_LABEL)\"
                in Keychain Access from your previous machine and retrieve its password,
                which is the key-pair to specify here. Any existing keys in Keychain Access
                may need to be removed first before proceeding.
